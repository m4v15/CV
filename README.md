# Matt Davis - CV

A highly motived and newly trained Full Stack Web Developer, graduate of the  competitive Founders & Coders bootcamp. Previous to Founders & Coders I was running the service kitchen at TRADE, a highly rated independent cafe in central London. I have strong technical skills, with a 1st Class Physics degree from Durham University, alongside the more focused learning at Founders & Coders. Conscientious and broad minded, I have experience working and communicating effectively with a wide range of people, having volunteered in Zambia, Palestine and Calais.

#### Currently learning

As someone who believes that there's always more to learn, I'm often trying to teach myself something new. Technologies I'm currently improving on:

- #### React.js
I have made a few small project with react, and I'm really enjoying learning it, along with redux
- #### Server side Python
Developing on top of the data analytics knowledge of it I developed during university

#### Future plans to learn

- #### Elm/Elixir/Phoenix
I have only heard good things, and it appears this stack is going to become more and more common, so I plan on getting to grips with it in the coming months

### Projects

#### Past
This are all projects I was one of multiple (2 or 4) lead developers on, during my time at founders and coders

- [EasyNaz](https://easynaz.herokuapp.com/): A graduate project developed with [Almanarah organisation](http://www.almanarah.org/eng/), to help identify accesible services in Nazareth [Github](https://github.com/FACN1/easyNaz)
- [Volunteer app] (https://tolife.herokuapp.com/): Another graduate project devised by me and a fellow student to help connect volunteers with organisations looking for help. [Github](https://github.com/FACN1/VolunteerApp)
- [Game Of Thrones API](https://github.com/FACN1/week3-javiasy): First project using API's, made after 3 weeks of web development learning!

#### Ongoing
- [Scoreboard](https://m4v15.github.io/CSB/public/index.html): A personal project made for myself to help keep track of scores in a game of contract whist. Currently on hold, whilst I learn react, at which point I plan to redevelop this using that framework.

### Experience

#### Founders & Coders Web Development Bootcamp (Nazareth & London)
- Took part as a student in a highly selective 16 week intensive web development course, which reignited my love for software development and problem solving.
- I am currently developing a proof of concept accessibility web app for a client based in Nazareth, with fellow graduates from the course.
- Strong focus on peer led learning, I have really learnt how to learn and teach better, and more productively, through
working alongside people above and below me in skill level.
- Working with students with lower levels of English really forced me to become a much clearer communicator of
complex, technical concepts.
- Also helping to deliver the next course, by helping plan and create new course materials.
- Founders and Coders has easily been one of the most formative and enriching experiences of my life - I took part in
the first cohort outside of London, in Nazareth, the largest Arab city in Israel, and it has expanded my horizons almost infinitely.
