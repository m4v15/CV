# Matt Davis - CV

A highly motived and newly trained Full Stack Web Developer, graduate of the  competitive Founders & Coders bootcamp. Previous to Founders & Coders I was running the service kitchen at TRADE, a highly rated independent cafe in central London. I have strong technical skills, with a 1st Class Physics degree from Durham University, alongside the more focused learning at Founders & Coders. Conscientious and broad minded, I have experience working and communicating effectively with a wide range of people, having volunteered in Zambia, Palestine and Calais.

#### Currently learning

As someone who believes that there's always more to learn, I'm often trying to teach myself something new. Technologies I'm currently improving on:

- #### React.js
I have made a few small project with react, and I'm really enjoying learning it, along with redux
- #### Server side Python
Developing on top of the data analytics knowledge of it I developed during university

#### Future plans to learn

- #### Elm/Elixir/Phoenix
I have only heard good things, and it appears this stack is going to become more and more common, so I plan on getting to grips with it in the coming months

### Experience

#### Founders & Coders Web Development Bootcamp (Nazareth & London)
- Took part as a student in a highly selective 16 week intensive web development course, which reignited my love for software development and problem solving.
- I am currently helping deliver the second iteration of the course in Nazareth as a mentor, facilitating the learning of local and international students. This involves planning and delivering content and working alongside and co-ordinating with other mentors
- Alongside this I am working with another graduate of the first course on the Nazareth Open Tourism Platform (see Projects)
- With a strong focus on peer led learning, I learnt how to learn and teach better, and more productively, through
working alongside people above and below me in skill level.
- Working with students with lower levels of English really forced me to become a much clearer communicator of
complex, technical concepts.
- Founders and Coders has easily been one of the most formative and enriching experiences of my life - I took part in
the first cohort outside of London, in Nazareth, the largest Arab city in Israel, and it has expanded my horizons almost infinitely.
